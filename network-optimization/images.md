## Loading Attribute

```html
<img src="image.png" loading="lazy" alt="â€¦" width="200" height="200">
```

- `auto`: Default lazy-loading behavior of the browser, which is the same as not including the attribute.
- `lazy`: Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.
- `eager`: Load the resource immediately, regardless of where it's located on the page.
