An A record (Address record) allows you to associate a domain name or subdomain with an IP address (32-bit).

AAAA record (IPv6)

An AAAA record is similar to an A record, but it allows you to point your domain to a 128-bit Ipv6 address.

ALIAS record

The ALIAS record is a virtual host record type which is used to point one domain name to another one, almost the same as CNAME. But the important difference here is that ALIAS can coexist with other records on that name. An ALIAS record can also be used if you wish to alias the root domain to another service (which is impossible with the help of a CNAME record).
