#### Class Descriptions


###### Software Development

An introduction to the development of largeÂ­ scale software. Topics include modularization, design patterns, documentation, unit testing, source code control, build systems, debuggers, and performance tuning; all of the tools necessary for developing software as opposed to writing small programs.


###### Cloud Computing

This course focuses on cloud programming, with an emphasis on using the cloud to solve Big Data problems. The course will not only look at how distributed systems, databases, networks, etc. are used to implement cloud computing platforms and cloud applications, but also the impact of the infinite scalability and pay-as-you-go on the platforms and applications.

###### Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science

Set theory, logic, discrete structures; induction and recursion; graphs and networks; techniques of proof. Examinations are proctored.


###### Calculus II

Continuation of MATH 122B or MATH 125. Techniques of symbolic and numerical integration, applications of the definite integral to geometry, physics, economics, and probability; differential equations from a numerical, graphical, and algebraic point of view; modeling using differential equations, approximations by Taylor series. A graphing calculator is required for this course.  We recommend the TI-83 or TI-84 models. Calculators that perform symbolic manipulations, such as the TI-89, NSpire CAS, or HP50g, cannot be used. Examinations are proctored
