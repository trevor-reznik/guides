### 2. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

Challenge yourself on kata, created by the community to strengthen different skills. Master your current language of choice, or expand your understanding of a new one.

Train on kata
Solve the kata with your coding style right in the browser and use test cases (TDD) to check it as you progress. Retrain with new, creative, and optimized approaches.

Earn ranks and honor
Kata are ranked to approximate difficulty. As you complete higher ranked kata, you progress through the ranks so we can match you with relevant challenges.

Gain collaborative wisdom
Compare your solution with others after each kata for greater understanding. Discuss the kata, best practices, and innovative techniques with the community.



### 3. [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

The purpose of this book is to give you a thorough introduction to competitive
programming. It is assumed that you already know the basics of programming,
but no previous background in competitive programming is needed.


The book is especially intended for students who want to learn algorithms
and possibly participate in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) or in
the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Of course, the book is
also suitable for anybody else interested in competitive programming.


It takes a long time to become a good competitive programmer, but it is also
an opportunity to learn a lot. You can be sure that you will get a good general
understanding of algorithms if you spend time reading the book, solving problems
and taking part in contests.

### 4. [Big-O Cheatsheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

This webpage covers the space and time Big-O complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science.  When preparing for technical interviews in the past, I found myself spending hours crawling the internet putting together the best, average, and worst case complexities for search and sorting algorithms so that I wouldn't be stumped when asked about them. 


### 5. [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

There are plenty of resources out there, but some are better than others. You don’t need yet another “200+ Free Online Courses” listicle. You need answers to these questions:

Which subjects should you learn, and why?
What is the best book or video lecture series for each subject?
This guide is our attempt to definitively answer these questions.

Study all nine subjects below, in roughly the presented order, using either the suggested textbook or video lecture series, but ideally both. Aim for 100-200 hours of study of each topic, then revisit favorites throughout your career
