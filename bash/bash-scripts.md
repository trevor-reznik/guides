# Variables

The `$#` variable holds the number of positional parameters/arguments passed to the function.


The `$0` variable is reserved for the functionâ€™s name.


The `$*` and `$@` variables hold all positional parameters/arguments passed to the function.


When double-quoted, `"$*"` expands to a single string separated by space (the first character of IFS) - `"$1 $2 $n"`.


When double-quoted, `"$@"` expands to separate strings - `"$1" "$2" "$n"`


When not double-quoted, `$*` and `$@` are the same.
